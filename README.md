# BePAPER

The [BePAPER project](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/research/research-projects/bepaper) will provide a first overview of the field of Belgian avant-garde works on paper within an international context between 1918 and 1950, that is, up and until the dawn of CoBrA and the rise of the so-called neo-avant-gardes. The project will contribute to a better definition of the collection category of “modern works on paper”.

BePAPER is a BRAIN project, supported by BELSPO.
